# Ringsurf lite üèÑ

This is a Firefox extension that makes navigating webrings a bit more smooth. When you press the extension icon, your browser will
navigate to a random webring's "random" URL. This saves you from finding the link on the page, and allows you to surf many webrings
at once.

## Why lite?

This is meant to be an minimal tool to help surf webrings.

I am working on a more robust solution as well with the following features:
1. Work on mobile
2. Sync your preferences across devices
4. Remember which sites you have been to
5. Extract the RSS feed from a site
6. And more!

## Settings

There are multiple settings for this extension:

*Open in new tab* - When set, each site will be opened in a new tab. Otherwise it will clobber the existing tab.

*Use Popup* - When set, use the extension popup each time. Otherwise clicking the extension icon will open a new random site.

*Webring URLs (one per line)* - URLs to use when navigating. These should be the webring's "random" URL. (eg. https://fediring.net/random)
