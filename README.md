# Ringsurf lite üèÑ

This is a Firefox extension that makes navigating webrings a bit more smooth. When you press the extension icon, your browser will
navigate to a random webring's "random" URL. This saves you from finding the link on the page, and allows you to surf many webrings
at once.

## Usage

### Popup Mode

By default everything you need should be in the extension popup when you click the surfboard icon.

### Stealth Mode

If you choose to not use the popup for navigation, you can still configure the extension. To get to this screen right click on the extension and choose "Manage extension". From there select the 3 dot menu and select "options". This will bring you to the following settings page.

### Settings

There are multiple settings for this extension:

*Open in new tab* - When set, each site will be opened in a new tab. Otherwise it will clobber the existing tab.

*Use Popup* - When set, use the extension popup each time. Otherwise clicking the extension icon will open a new random site.

*Webring URLs (one per line)* - URLs to use when navigating. These should be the webring's "random" URL. (eg. https://fediring.net/random)

## Why lite?

This is meant to be an minimal tool to help surf webrings.

I am working on a more robust solution as well with the following features:
1. Work on mobile
2. Sync your preferences across devices
4. Remember which sites you have been to
5. Extract the RSS feed from a site
6. And more!
